To build this succesfully, you will need the following supporting libraries and tools:
- CMake
- nlohmann's JSon parsing library
- spdlog library
- Boost system and filesystem libraries

You can get these by issuing on Debian/Ubuntu based systems:
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install cmake libspdlog-dev nlohman-json3-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev
