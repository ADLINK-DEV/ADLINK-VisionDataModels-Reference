# ADLINK-VisionDataModels-Reference
This repository is the result of a consolidation of several sources:
https://github.com/ADLINK-DEV/AppDataModelsV1.0
https://gitlab.com/oasys/adlink/vision/data-models.git

A TagGroup is defined by name:context:version. In this repository, the definition is stored under _context/version/nameTagGroup.json_

This means that all TagGroups from the same context (eg. com.adlinktech.vision) are grouped together under their versions.

Note that some TagGroups may be versioned separately from others, so make sure that if you want the latest, you examine the directories closely.

Any desired changes can be made by creating a PR and submitting it for review. 

It will then be examined and reviewed, and if deemed appropriate become part of the repositories.
